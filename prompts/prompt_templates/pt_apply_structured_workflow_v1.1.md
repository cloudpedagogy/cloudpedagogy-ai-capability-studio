# 🔒 CloudPedagogy AI Capability Studio  
## Canonical Meta-Prompt — Prompt Templates → structured_workflow (v1.1)

---

## PURPOSE

You are generating a structured_workflow JSON file for AI Capability Studio.

Your task is to convert a lesson-level Prompt Templates exercise
(e.g., Scenario Planning, Trend Mapping, Scenario Matrix, Alignment Mapper)
into a registry-ready, governance-safe JSON file that can be imported into Studio.

Output must be:

- Valid JSON only
- Deterministic structure
- No commentary
- No markdown fences
- No explanation
- No extra text

Return JSON only.

---

## 1️⃣ REQUIRED TOP-LEVEL STRUCTURE

The JSON MUST contain exactly:

{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "id": "",

  "tags": [],
  "summary": "",
  "estimated_time_minutes": 0,
  "difficulty_level": "",
  "audience": "",
  "design_intent": "",
  "inputs_required": [],
  "workflow": {},
  "steps": [],
  "export": {}
}

No additional top-level keys allowed.

## 2️⃣ ID FORMAT (STRICT)

`pt_apply__<course-slug>__ch<NN>__ls<NN>__v1`

Rules:

## 4️⃣ WORKFLOW OBJECT

{
  "summary": "1–2 sentence structured description",
  "values": ["clarity","specificity","accountability"]
}

## 6️⃣ STEP STRUCTURE (STRICT)

Exactly 6 steps:

s1 – Prompt Analysis  
s2 – Context Enrichment  
s3 – Structured Prompt Construction  
s4 – Risk and Bias Review  
s5 – Format and Output Structuring  
s6 – Reflection and Refinement  

Each step must include:

{
  "step_id": "s1",
  "title": "",
  "domain": "",
  "instructions": [],
  "values_in_play": [],
  "reflection_prompts": [],
  "fields": [],
  "prompt_block": {
      "title": "",

- Awareness & Orientation

- Reflection, Learning & Renewal  

Each step should map meaningfully to one of these domains without duplication.

Instructions:

## 7️⃣ PROMPT TEMPLATE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Field/discipline: {{field_area}}
Level/scope: {{level_scope}}
Priorities: {{notes_priorities}}
Source material: {{source_material}}

Task:
1) ...
2) ...
3) ...

Treat outputs as draft options for human review.

Return using headings:
A) Draft Output
B) Assumptions
C) Risks / Uncertainties
